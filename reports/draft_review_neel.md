# Draft Review - Neel Dhulipala

## Question
*What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?*

The question that the team is answering seems pretty clear: how do "fair" strategies evolve in terms of the Ultimatum Game? In a game where accepting is always beneficial and rejecting
only harms the responder, it is fair to ask why players would be more "fair" than "reasonable". I feel like the team could elaborate more in the abstract about their question, since besides 
the explanation of how the game works and the quote from the original paper, the authors of this draft report did not elaborate so much with their own words.

## Methodology
*Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?*

The methodology makes sense. It would be nicer if *p* and *q* were defined earlier on, as it was introduced in the first bullet of the proof and defined in both the third and seventh bullet.
Also it is not clear what happens after *w* of all players hear about an acceptance. Does their value change? Also, does the fact that the total number of offspring is proportional to the parent's \
payoff mean that weaker players will never get killed off? Other than that the idea of the replication is fairly straightforward. The extension looks very interesting to explore. Are there other papers out 
there that consider this?

## Results
*Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?*

The results are fairly straightforward. The visualizations from both their simulation and the original paper's simulation look very similar, which means the replication succeeded. 
All graphs are labeled correctly.

## Interpretation
*Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?*

There does not seem to be an interpretation in this draft report. The results are presented but not analyzed. I am assuming it will be a lot easier to do that once the extension 
is implemented. However, I do want to know what the authors' interpretation of this data is. Why do agents seem to evolve in this way?

## Replication
*Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?*

The results from the report are very consistent from that in the paper. The two figures have very similar trends. The consistency is shown as quantitative, since it is shown through 
the two figures being similar.

## Extension
*Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?*

As stated before, the extension is explained very clearly and is super intriguing. I would be very interested to learn more about the difference between unanimous approval and majority approval and 
how that plays out in the Ultimatum Game. I cannot wait for its implementation!

## Progress
*Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?*

The progress on the extension is unclear from the draft report itself. Currently it does not seem to be implemented. They did point out the concern about how the semester has ramped 
up very recently and has made working on this project very taxing, which I can heavily relate to. I hope this does not severely impact the extension, and with that I wish them the 
very best of luck. They do need more interpretation of their replication, but their replication looks complete.

## Presentation
*Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide (Links to an external site.)?*

The report was very easy to understand and read, and the language was fairly clear and concise. I have the style check filled out below.

1) **PASS?**: The abstract is very short and concise, but it can use more detail. More interpretation of the original text would be great.

2) **PASS**: The paper is written in active voice. 

3) **PASS**: Most of the report when appropriate is in present tense.

4) **PASS**: The report is concise and does not seem to have any redundant words.

5) **PASS?**: You used "very" twice in your concerns section, which will not go in your final report, so I'll let it slide.

6) **PASS**: None of the specified words are used, which means they are not used incorrectly.

7) **PASS**: The report is very easy to understand for a more general audience. It is very readable and not too technical to the point of confusion.

8) **FAIL**: The paper does not explain the motivation behind answering the question. Why is it useful? What do we as the readers get out of it?

9) **PASS**: The report is written in a very logical order: question, methodology, results, and ... right, you guys need an interpretation for your results still. **FAIL**. 

10) **FAIL**: The figures are not titled, captioned, or have any Figure numbers.

11) **PASS**: The number that are in the paper do have a logical amount of significant digits. 

12) **FAIL**: There are a decent number of spelling and some grammatical errors. I would plug this report into Grammarly before you submit it as your final.

## Mechanics
*Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?*

The report is in the right directory with the right file name, does seem to be formatted professionally in Markdown, has a meaningful title with the authors' full names, and the bibliography is in an acceptable style.
